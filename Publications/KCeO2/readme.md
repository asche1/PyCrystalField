# This directory includes the data and the code used to analyze the CEF-phonon coupling for KCeO2.

The three scripts (all Jupyter python notebooks) are:
### 1. KCeO2_CEF-PhononModel
Takes the DFT calculations and builds a point charge model to describe the phonon distortions.

### 2. KCeO2_ToyModel
Makes a simple toy model to describe KCeO2 and NaCeO2 based on a somple optical phonon

### 3. KCeO2_RefitData
Refit the KCeO2 inelastic neutron scattering data with the toy model constructed in the previous script
